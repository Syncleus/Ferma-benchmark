# Ferma Benchmarks

This is a simple application to act as a benchmark comparing the Ferma Graph-to-Object layer with Totorom, TinkerPop
Frames, and TinkerPop Blueprints. It will help us ensure Ferma remains the top-performing option.

For more information see the main [Ferma Project page](https://github.com/freemo/Ferma-benchmark).
